[Verse]
Zero ones and ones are twos
Binary dance it's got no clues
Counting up like it's some game
Bits and bytes they're not the same

[Verse 2]
One oh one is five they say
Nerdy jokes to save the day
Strange math class is in session
Counting high with no compression

[Chorus]
Bit by bit and byte by byte
Binary life it feels so right
Nerdy bliss in ones and zeros
Teaching jokes we'll be the heroes

[Verse 3]
Zero one one it's a three
Computers laugh but you can't see
Dad jokes flying left and right
Numb your brain with data's light

[Verse 4]
Eight-bit byte is just an ocean
Where ones and zeros set in motion
Counting sheep in binary sleep
Dreaming of a nerdy leap

[Chorus]
Bit by bit and byte by byte
Binary life it feels so right
Nerdy bliss in ones and zeros
Teaching jokes we'll be the heroes
